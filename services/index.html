<p>Upgrades Scan2Track systems should be automatic without or with very little downtime. </p>
<p>Any updates must be 100% compatible with the new version, eliminating the tedious task of rewriting customizations and complementary software.</p>
<p>ERP systems can be expensive to update, but with Scan2Track ERP the cost of upgrades is included in the subscription fee. </p>

<h3>Examples of the upgrades include:</h3>
<p>•   New search function</p>
<p>•   New Reports</p>
<p>•   Android Mobile version upgrades</p>
<p>•   Customer feature feedback</p>
<p>•   Adapt to new industry regulations</p>

<h2>Servers</h2>
<p>The Scan2Track servers are not located in any Scan2Track offices. The servers reside in a secure data facility in secure, natural disaster-controlled environment.</p>
<p>Client data is stored on separate servers always.</p>
<p>The servers have 24-hour security.</p> <br>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Data encryption is used in the Scan2Track network.</p>
<p>A firewall is used in the Scan2Track network.</p>
<p>Real-time protection is used to protect against malware, viruses, spyware, adware and malicious attacks.</p>
<p>Un Interruptible power supplies are used to ensure the data backups and security measures are always working.</p> <br>

<h2>Data Backup & Restoration</h2>
<p>Scan2Track takes data security and maintenance very seriously. Client data is stored at a data center that receives regular backups, stored on multiple servers, and prepared for severe weather conditions. </p> <br>

<h2>Data Restoration</h2>
<p>The system is set up, so it is difficult to accidentally delete information. If the information is deleted, it will still appear but with a status of “Deleted.” Therefore, if something was inadvertently deleted, the data can be copied and restored. If data is maliciously deleted, Scan2Track will work with clients in a case-by-case basis to restore the data in a timely manner.  </p> <br>

<h2>Client Backups</h2>
<p>Client data is backed up on a regular basis. All data is stored on different servers and backed up daily.
Daily backups allows for version control and security.  </p> <br>

<h2>User Backups</h2>
<p>In addition to the Scan2Track backups, we encourage our clients to regularly export their data.
This acts as another backup and for personal records. </p>
